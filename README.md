## Prerequisites
- Go: >= 1.21.0

## Examples

This repo contains an [example](examples) based on the [Ticket Reservation Service](https://github.com/restatedev/examples/tree/main/tutorials/tour-of-restate-go).

You can also check a list of examples available here: https://github.com/restatedev/examples?tab=readme-ov-file#go

### How to use the example

Download and run restate, as described here [v1.x](https://github.com/restatedev/restate/releases/)

```bash
restate-server
```

In another terminal run the example

```bash
cd restate-sdk-go/example
go run .
```

In a third terminal register:

```bash
restate deployments register http://localhost:9080
```

And do the following steps

- Add tickets to basket

```bash
curl -v localhost:8080/UserSession/azmy/AddTicket \
    -H 'content-type: application/json' \
    -d '"ticket-1"'

# true
curl -v localhost:8080/UserSession/azmy/AddTicket \
    -H 'content-type: application/json' \
    -d '"ticket-2"'
# true
```

Trying adding the same tickets again should return `false` since they are already reserved. If you didn't check out the tickets in 15min (if you are impatient change the delay in code to make it shorter)

- Check out

```bash
curl localhost:8080/UserSession/azmy/Checkout
# true
```

## Ingress SDK

When you need to call a restate handlers or attaching to an invocation from outside of a restate context,
use the [ingress SDK](docs/ingress.md).

### Internal core

To rebuild the internal core:

```shell
cd shared-core
cargo build --release
mv target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/shared_core_golang_wasm_binding.wasm ../internal/statemachine
```

To regenerate the protobuf contract between core and SDK:

```shell
buf generate --template internal.buf.gen.yaml
```

## Mockery mocks
The `mock` package is mostly autogenerated but will require some very light editing. To generate run `mockery` in the root of this repo. Then check the git diff.
Certain structs (`MockAfterFuture`, `MockAttachFuture`, `MockAwakeableFuture`, `MockDurablePromise`, `MockResponseFuture`) and functions (`NewMockClient`, `NewMockContext`)
have been redefined in `helpers.go` and commented out in their respective files. Please continue this state of affairs if you regenerate mocks - not doing so will be a build
error.
